# aws-saml-go
Simple credential_process app that will use your browser session to get a SAML auth for AWS.

Assumes that your IdP is configured to redirect back to `http://127.0.0.1:35002/` after authentication and has only been
tested with Google's SAML assertions.

## Config

Configurations are done via the `~/.aws/config` file. Just place the binary downloaded from 
the [releases](https://github.com/henriquevcosta/aws-saml-go/releases) on your filesystem
and adjust the path in the config file.

The IDP-specific configs can be made explicit in a `saml_idp <name>` section of the config and then pointing to it from a `saml.idp_config=<name>` property.

```ini
[default]
region = ap-southeast-2
saml.idp_config=google

[saml_idp google]
# this is a google SAML example where the SP is configured in the Google Admin console as
# redirecting back to http://127.0.0.1:35002/
# IIIIIIIII and SSSSSSSSSS would be your IDP ID and SP ID respectively
saml.idp_url = https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/initsso?idpid=IIIIIIIII&spid=SSSSSSSSSS&forceauthn=false
# Optional
saml.duration = 1000

[saml_idp another_idp]
# Some other generic IDP that returns the same structure of SAML assertion as google
saml.idp_url = https://some-url
# Optional
saml.duration = 3000

[profile prof1]
# Will inherit the idp config from the default section
account = 1111111111
saml.role_arn = arn:aws:iam::1111111111:role/the-role
credential_process = /path/to/aws-saml-go prof1

[profile prof2]
region = us-east-2
account = 1111111111
saml.role_arn = arn:aws:iam::1111111111:role/the-role
credential_process = /path/to/aws-saml-go prof2
# Inline idp configs
saml.idp_url = https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/initsso?idpid=IIIIIIIII&spid=SSSSSSSSSS&forceauthn=false
# Optional
saml.duration = 1000

[profile prof3]
region = us-east-2
account = 1111111111
saml.idp_config=another_idp
# Overriding the default profile
saml.role_arn = arn:aws:iam::1111111111:role/the-role
credential_process = /path/to/aws-saml-go prof3
# Optional
saml.duration = 3600

```

## Usage

This tool conforms to AWS's `credential_process` format so you can use it in any way that you can use AWS profiles. 

In other words, once you've configured some profile `prof1` like explained in the previous section you can run any AWS CLI command with that profile and see the browser open up for authentication.
```
aws s3 ls --profile prof1

# OR

AWS_PROFILE=prof1 aws s3 l3

OR

export AWS_PROFILE=prof1
...
aws s3 ls
```

You can just run any of the above approaches or you can use some more sofisticated tools like [Granted](https://www.granted.dev/) or [AWSume](https://awsu.me/general/quickstart.html).

## Command line flags

You can pass additional flags in the `credential_process` property of the profile in the AWS config to tune the behavior:

```
 --port 12345      Use a different port number for your IdP callback (default 35002)
 --cache keychain  Use a different system to cache your credentials. Valid values are `keychain` (macOS only) and `none` for now.
 --debug           Enable debug logging - THIS WILL LOG YOUR CREDENTIALS TO THE OUTPUT
 --duration 2000   Set the session duration in seconds. Overrides the configuration at profile level. Will be reduced to the maximum duration configured in IdP if this exceeds it. Default is 3600.
 --help            Prints usage information
```

Example:
```
[profile prof1]
account = 1111111111
saml.role_arn = arn:aws:iam::1111111111:role/the-role
credential_process = /path/to/aws-saml-go --duration 5000 prof1
```

# Credit

A lot of this tool's working and some of the code is inspired from https://github.com/bengieeee/aws-google-saml. I just built this because I wanted a binary that wasn't dependent on Python.
